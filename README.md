# J.A.R.V.I.S - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

> "Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk." - Tony Stark

An AI desktop assistant inspired by Iron Man's JARVIS. Built with Python, powered by free-first local command routing with optional Groq cloud AI, and designed to combine voice control, desktop automation, memory, productivity helpers, plugin safety, release checks, and a cinematic cyber interface in one Windows-first system.

J.A.R.V.I.S can run in a keyless degraded mode. Local rules, the desktop UI, memory helpers, health checks, and many system commands work without API keys. Groq, Spotify, Gemini, and other cloud-backed capabilities are optional integrations.

## Installation

Requirements:

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.11+
- Optional: a working microphone for voice input
- Optional: speakers or an audio output device for voice responses

Recommended install:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Developer install:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Manual package install:

```powershell
python -m pip install speechrecognition edge-tts pygame psutil requests groq spotipy pyautogui pyperclip customtkinter python-dotenv vosk schedule
python -m pip install pyaudio
```

If `pyaudio` fails on your machine, install it using a Windows wheel or your preferred package method.

Check installation:

```powershell
python kontrol.py --no-pause
```

---

## Setup

### 1. Groq API Key

- Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com)
- Create an API key
- Copy your key

Groq is optional. Without it, J.A.R.V.I.S keeps local rule-based commands available and reports local-only mode.

### 2. Gemini API Key

- Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- Create an API key
- Copy your key

Gemini is optional and currently reserved for future vision and multimodal workflows.

### 3. Spotify API Optional

- Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- Create an app
- Add this redirect URI:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback
```

- Copy your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`

Spotify is optional. Without it, Spotify commands return a clear disabled-mode message and the rest of the assistant continues.

### 4. Create Your `.env` File

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Then fill only the integrations you want:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=
JARVIS_ENABLE_GROQ=false
JARVIS_GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant
JARVIS_AI_MODE=auto
GEMINI_API_KEY=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=
JARVIS_ENABLE_SPOTIFY=false
```

Important:

- Never share your real `.env`
- Never push your real `.env` to GitHub
- Only commit `.env.example`
- Rotate any key that was ever exposed publicly

## Voice Commands

### Activation

Say `Jarvis` to wake the assistant. After the command completes, it returns to standby mode. Voice is optional: if wake-word mode or the microphone is unavailable, the UI and text/local command paths remain usable. Push-to-talk is the intended fallback path for systems where always-listening wake-word mode is disabled.

### Applications

| Say | Action |

---

## Safety

Dangerous actions are blocked unless explicitly allowed. This includes:

- shutdown
- restart
- sleep
- lock screen
- unsafe URLs
- risky plugin entrypoints
- destructive desktop actions
- risky input automation

Safety controls include:

- `JARVIS_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_ACTIONS=false` by default
- `JARVIS_PERMISSION_PROFILE=normal` by default
- URL normalization that only allows HTTP and HTTPS browser links
- plugin path traversal checks
- plugin signature verification
- privacy mode for sensitive sessions
- secret masking before runtime event logs are written

Jarvis will use confirmation and permission controls where the action policy requires it.

---

## Keyless And Degraded Mode

J.A.R.V.I.S is designed to start without optional credentials.

| Missing item | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `.env` | Startup continues with defaults |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq cloud routing is disabled; local rule commands still work |
| `JARVIS_ENABLE_GROQ=false` | Groq cloud routing is disabled even if a key is present |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` / `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Spotify actions are disabled with an actionable message |
| `JARVIS_ENABLE_SPOTIFY=false` | Spotify actions are disabled even if credentials are present |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Future Gemini-backed flows stay unavailable |
| Microphone | UI and non-voice flows can still load; voice input reports an error state |
| Audio mixer | Voice output is disabled with a warning instead of crashing |

---

## Health And Quality

Current project quality checks include:

- automated health checker
- runtime service validation
- startup degraded-mode reporting for missing Groq, Spotify, microphone, and STT mode
- deterministic and measured eval coverage
- unit tests
- Ruff linting
- static project audit
- repository hygiene scanning
- public source secret and personal-data scanning
- public release readiness scanning
- memory and action history tracking
- release signing smoke checks
- signed model catalog verification
- feature quality reporting
- UI smoke and screenshot regression checks

Current verified baseline:

| Check | Current result |
| --- | --- |
| Unit tests | `228 passed` |
| Ruff | `All checks passed` |
| Project audit | `No static findings detected` |
| Repository hygiene | `PUBLIC RELEASE HYGIENE: PASS` after cleanup |
| Public source release check | `PUBLIC SOURCE RELEASE CHECK: PASS` |
| Public release readiness | `Ready: yes` |
| UI smoke | `UI smoke: ok` |
| UI screenshot regression | `dashboard`, `system`, `integrations`, and `security` passed |
| Health status | No critical blockers in keyless mode, with expected warnings |

Expected warnings in a fresh keyless setup:

- Groq API key not configured
- Spotify credentials missing
- optional release signing key missing
- microphone calibration not completed
- onboarding not completed

## Compared With Other Jarvis Projects

Open.Jarvis is strongest in free-first desktop automation, local command routing, conservative safety gates, test coverage, health checks, release artifacts, and quality tracking. Larger assistant projects may be stronger in packaged distribution, cloud-scale integrations, community plugin ecosystems, and mature agent frameworks.

| Area | Open.Jarvis status | Gap before public maturity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safety | Destructive actions blocked by default, plugin signatures and sandbox helpers exist | Add stronger per-action confirmation UX |
| Quality | Unit tests, Ruff, audit, health check, eval artifacts, and screenshot regression exist | Add a larger eval set |
| Extensibility | Plugin trust, marketplace core, and plugin runner exist | Add remote signed plugin catalogs |
| Offline | Vosk fallback and offline profile planning exist | Add guided local STT/TTS/LLM installers |
| UX | Custom UI, onboarding, settings, runtime logs, health center, memory center | Add screenshots, guided calibration, and release installer |
| Agentic work | Workflow planning helpers exist | Add real developer agents with explicit sandbox and approvals |

---

## Settings Reference

Open.Jarvis v0.6.0 adds a central configuration manager for non-secret preferences. Existing `.env` and environment variables remain supported for compatibility, especially for optional integration secrets.

Configuration precedence is:

1. built-in safe defaults
2. environment variables and legacy `.env` values
3. user-local `settings.json` for non-secret settings
4. explicit Settings UI saves

Source mode stores non-secret settings in the current user's local app data. Portable mode saves non-secret settings to `config/settings.json` in the extracted portable copy. Real `settings.json` files are private user data and must not be committed or shipped in release ZIPs.

Secrets remain environment-only. The Settings UI shows only masked status for API keys, OAuth secrets, tokens, release signing keys, and plugin signing keys. Open.Jarvis does not claim encrypted vault storage or cloud sync.

### Memory Privacy And Data Control

Open.Jarvis v0.7.0 builds on the settings system with local memory privacy controls. When `privacy.privacy_mode` is enabled or `privacy.memory_enabled` is disabled in non-secret settings, normal note, habit, and detected-preference collection does not add new persistent memory writes. Explicit user-directed data controls remain available so existing local memory can be viewed, listed, deleted, cleared, or exported.

Memory exports are masked JSON snapshots intended for a user-selected private path. They mask secret-like assignments and sensitive preference keys, but notes and habits can still be personal data. Do not commit exports, `memory.json`, `config/settings.json`, logs, or other private runtime files.

### Provider System And AI Fallback Control

Open.Jarvis v0.8.0 routes AI-style command analysis through a local-first provider system. The local provider uses deterministic command rules and requires no network or API key. Groq remains optional and is isolated behind an explicit provider adapter.

Cloud fallback is disabled by default. Groq is called only when local routing cannot handle a command and non-secret settings explicitly enable cloud fallback, Groq, and the Groq cloud provider. A configured `GROQ_API_KEY` alone does not make cloud fallback mandatory.

Provider prompts use the existing memory privacy gate. When `privacy.privacy_mode` is enabled or `privacy.memory_enabled` is disabled, persisted notes, preferences, and habits are not attached to provider prompts. If cloud fallback is enabled, command text may be sent to the selected cloud provider; Open.Jarvis does not claim encryption or that cloud providers never receive data.
