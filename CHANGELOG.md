## Unreleased

## v1.0.0 - Stable Release

### Added

- Added stable release readiness documentation for the first `v1.0.0` release line.
- Added explicit stable-release scope and limitations so public docs do not overclaim sandboxing, encryption, installer signing, or cloud privacy behavior.

### Changed

- Aligned package metadata and CLI version output with the `1.0.0` stable release.
- Updated README, SECURITY, and CONTRIBUTING guidance for stable public release readiness while preserving v0.9.0 security hardening language.

### Verified

- Stable readiness is covered by README/version contract tests, release checks, hygiene checks, security tests, provider tests, memory privacy tests, Ruff, unittest, pytest, and CI-equivalent smoke commands.

### Added

- Added an optimization workflow document with scan baselines, latency targets, UI performance work, memory cleanup, and release gates.
- Added GPU telemetry to the cockpit status strip while keeping Groq AI visibility.
- Added premium HUD depth effects, sidebar pulse dots, terminal corner accents, and animated mini-reactor details.
- Added dashboard assistant state profiles for booting, standby, listening, processing, executing, speaking, error, and offline modes.
- Added structured command stream events with `[INFO]`, `[VOICE]`, `[CMD]`, `[TASK]`, `[OK]`, `[WARN]`, and `[ERROR]` prefixes.
- Added sidebar navigation for Dashboard, System Monitor, Modules, Integrations, Security, and Settings pages.
- Added live secondary page data for system telemetry, module readiness, integrations, security, and settings.
- Added runtime lifecycle UI events for listening, routing, executing, speaking, completion, and failure states.
- Added screenshot regression checks for core cockpit pages to catch blank or visually broken UI renders.
- Added public release readiness reporting for docs, local hygiene, quality gates, and signing readiness.
- Added repository hygiene and public release commands for GitHub publication preparation.
- Added recursive hygiene scanning for generated artifacts, bytecode, archives, runtime event streams, and suspicious non-placeholder secret assignments.
- Added v0.3.0 local plugin manifest validation, plugin permission registry, safe plugin context, registry, loader, lifecycle hooks, and failure-isolation tests.
- Added plugin developer documentation for manifests, permissions, lifecycle hooks, and safe local testing.
- Added v0.4.0 voice UX foundations: explicit voice state machine, safer wake-word matching, microphone diagnostics, push-to-talk fallback, TTS queue, and injected voice controller tests.
- Added voice setup and troubleshooting documentation for optional wake-word, push-to-talk, microphone, TTS, and offline STT behavior.
- Added v0.5.0 Windows portable package policy, dry-run build workflow, artifact verifier, and release-focused tests.
- Added Windows portable usage and build documentation with SmartScreen, privacy, and cleanup guidance.
- Added v0.6.0 configuration foundations: typed non-secret settings schema, ConfigManager, user-local and portable-aware paths, validation diagnostics, safe export, environment compatibility bridge, and Settings UI model.
- Added release-safety coverage to keep real `config/settings.json` files out of source and portable packages.
- Added v0.7.0 memory privacy and data controls for masked listing/viewing, explicit note deletion, clear, and masked JSON export flows.
- Added v0.8.0 provider routing foundations with a local-first provider, isolated Groq provider adapter, explicit cloud fallback control, and provider privacy tests.
- Added v0.9.0 security hardening helpers for process command validation, scoped path checks, stricter URL rejection, plugin loader entrypoint boundaries, and plugin/runtime artifact coverage.

### Changed

- Split the monolithic product feature test suite into smaller domain-focused files for easier CI triage and maintenance.
- Updated README status and license information for GitHub publication.
- Cleaned repository ignore rules into plain English.
- Expanded environment template comments around free-first and optional integrations.
- Removed visible Settings, Plugins, Logs, and large wake-word control clutter from the main cockpit.
- Kept the assistant in wake-word standby with a minimal `STANDBY - SAY JARVIS` status.
- Hardened startup greeting voice output so TTS failures are logged without stopping the runtime.
- Kept arc reactor labels inside the canvas at smaller UI sizes.
- Updated the cockpit background to the blue-black `#0B0E1B` palette, reduced reactor label overlap, and modernized the window control cluster.
- Fine-tuned reactor label spacing, moved the title/subtitle block lower, and restyled the window controls into a flat dark strip with cyan controls.
- Removed the custom top-right window control strip, centered the date capsule independently, and refined vertical spacing around the reactor and title stack.
- Rebuilt the cockpit around the reference HUD layout with the requested palette, left icon rail, framed shell, terminal equalizer, top controls, and bottom status dock.
- Animated the terminal equalizer and bottom waveform so both HUD signal areas update continuously instead of using static drawings.
- Moved reusable HUD canvas drawing into `ui_hud_effects.py` to keep the main desktop window easier to maintain.
- Connected the reactor, status line, subtitle, title, equalizer activity, and runtime UI callbacks to the assistant state system.
- Normalized legacy runtime UI messages into professional terminal event categories.
- Split sidebar navigation and secondary page builders into focused UI modules.
- Replaced Phase 4 placeholder cards with live status/value/detail cards.
- Connected command routing, action execution, and TTS speech output to the cockpit state machine.
- Added a visual quality gate that captures Dashboard, System Monitor, Integrations, and Security pages.
- Updated CI dependency installation to include developer tooling required for linting and PyInstaller release builds.
- Hardened `.gitignore` for Python caches, env files, logs, archives, coverage output, IDE files, and generated release artifacts while keeping `.env.example` trackable.
- Treated release signing as optional for public source releases while keeping signing checks visible for executable and model artifact releases.
- Documented source release exclusions and pytest-compatible test execution.
- Reduced optional integration traceback noise for Groq, Spotify, microphone input, and TTS audio fallback paths.
- Improved plugin marketplace metadata with plugin IDs, permission summaries, risk levels, and manifest compatibility warnings.
- Preserved legacy plugin manifest compatibility while guiding new plugins toward stable `id` and explicit `permissions` fields.
- Hardened wake-word listener matching to use normalized whole-token detection and wake-word disabled mode.
- Expanded `.env.example` with optional voice, wake-word, push-to-talk, and TTS flags.
- Kept portable packaging additive to the source workflow and documented full installer support as future work.
- Updated the Settings UI path so non-secret preferences save through ConfigManager instead of writing raw `.env` files.
- Connected normal note, habit, and preference writes to ConfigManager privacy flags so privacy mode can stop new persistent memory collection.
- Changed AI fallback defaults so local routing remains first and Groq cloud fallback stays off unless explicitly enabled in non-secret settings and environment configuration.
- Hardened runtime process helpers to keep `shell=False` while blocking destructive executables, shell execution flags, and pipe-to-shell command patterns unless a guarded runtime action explicitly permits them.
- Hardened release hygiene and portable policy coverage for plugin cache/state artifacts alongside provider cache/state artifacts.

### Verified

- Product feature coverage now runs through focused startup/workflow, command/provider, security/memory, release/eval, audio/offline, and quality/maintenance test modules.
- Plugin coverage now includes manifest validation, permission boundaries, safe context behavior, registry discovery, loader isolation, lifecycle hooks, and security-boundary tests.
- Voice coverage now uses mocked microphone, wake-word, push-to-talk, TTS, and controller flows without requiring real audio hardware.
- Portable release coverage now verifies artifact layout, dry-run behavior, include rules, private-data exclusions, folder checks, and ZIP traversal rejection without running PyInstaller.
- Security coverage now includes command/process safety, path traversal, unsafe URL protocols, plugin entrypoint boundaries, and plugin/provider runtime artifact blockers.
- Unit tests, Ruff linting, project audit, health check, and feature quality checks are used as the current quality gate.
